# MazeGame
This is a maze game where you have to kill the monsters without running out of attempts, the instructions are in the README, good luck!.

This are the instructions: 
This is a game called "Maze Game" which is about monsters that are generated in a matrix and there are different ways to win. Killing all the monsters with the different attacks there are: (i) Shoot with a rubber band, (ii) Hit with a nail stick, (iii) Throw a Molotov, (v) Throw a bomb. Those are the attacks, although there is also another one that is (iv) Mount blockade, which is in charge of restricting the movement of the monsters, the other way to win is by immobilizing all the monsters, except for the heart monster that clears the blocks in case you land on one of these, those are the ways to win. Now, the way to lose is to run out of attempts you have, which luckily there are many. Enjoy the game and I hope you have fun.
